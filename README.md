# Project Title
BikeShare Data Analysis Project

### Date Created
October 25, 2024

### Description
This project analyzes bikeshare data from three major cities to understand usage patterns and trends. It allows users to filter data by month, day of the week, and city, providing insights into metrics like the most common travel times, popular stations, trip duration, and user demographics.

### Files Used
- `bikeshare.py`: The main Python script for running the analysis.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`: The datasets containing bikeshare information for each city.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, datetime

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdsnd_github.git` from Udacity master hub
2. Run `bikeshare.py` using Python to interact with the bikeshare data.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to filter the data and view results.

### Usage Examples MARKED UPDATE FOR TASK 3

To run the BikeShare data analysis program and explore bikeshare data, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Python Script**:
   - In the terminal, navigate to the project directory.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     python bikeshare.py
     ```
   - You will be prompted to choose a city, month, and day of the week to analyze.

2. **Example Analysis Workflow**:
   - After running `bikeshare.py`, you’ll see prompts like:
     ```
     Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York City, or Washington?
     ```
     Type the name of the city (e.g., `Chicago`) and press Enter.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the month and day for filtering data, or type "all" to view data across all months or days.

3. **Sample Output**:
   - After selecting your filters, the script will provide various insights, such as:
     - **Most common travel times** (e.g., most popular hour of travel)
     - **Popular stations** (start and end stations with the most traffic)
     - **Trip duration** (average and total duration of trips)
     - **User demographics** (e.g., types of users, gender, birth year statistics)
   - Here’s an example output for travel time:
     ```
     Most Popular Start Hour: 17:00
     ```

4. **Exiting the Program**:
   - At any time, you can follow the prompt to restart or exit the program. 

### Sample Code Snippet
```python
# Sample code for importing and running main functions in bikeshare.py
import bikeshare

# Run the main function to start the interactive session
bikeshare.main()
